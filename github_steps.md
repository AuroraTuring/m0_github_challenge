Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub. 

Go to your GitHub repository and copy the SSH code. 
Go to your terminal and navigate to the directory you wish to connect. 
Paste the SSH code and enter. 
git add your file and initial commit it. 
Push the changes, and refresh your GitHub to see the connection!
